# Multi-Agents Hiring and E-Commerce Labs

This repository contains two lab projects that demonstrate the use of AI agents in different contexts:

## 1. Hiring Process Lab (`/hiring-autogen`)

This lab showcases how multiple AI agents can collaborate in a hiring process workflow. The agents simulate different roles in a hiring pipeline, such as:

- Recruiters screening resumes
- HR specialists coordinating interviews
- Technical interviewers evaluating skills
- Hiring managers making final decisions

The lab demonstrates multi-agent communication, decision-making processes, and workflow automation in a hiring context.

## 2. E-Commerce Shopping Lab (`/ecommerce_shopping_agent`)

This lab demonstrates an AI shopping assistant that helps users navigate an e-commerce platform. Features include:

- Product discovery and recommendation
- Order processing and tracking
- Customer support for frequently asked questions
- Shopping cart management

The lab shows how conversational agents can enhance the online shopping experience through natural language interactions.
